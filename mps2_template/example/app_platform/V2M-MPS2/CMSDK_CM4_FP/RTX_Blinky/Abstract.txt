The 'RTX_Blinky' project is a simple CMSIS RTOS Kernel based example for
ARM 'Cortex-M4' microcontroller using ARM 'V2M-MPS2' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  50 MHz
   - CCLK  =  25 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor
driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating the activation of
the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  Simulator:      configured for software Simulator

  FastModels:     configured for FastModels MPS2 Simulator

  V2M-MPS2:       configured for MPS2
