The 'ARMv8MBL_s_ns' project is a simple demo program for
ARM 'ARMv8M Baseline' microcontroller using ARM 'V2M-MPS2' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  50 MHz
   - CCLK  =  25 MHz

The example demonstartes the interworking between secure and un-secure mode
on an ARMv8M Baseline microcontroller.

The ARMv8MBL_s_ns program is available in different targets:

  Fast Model:           configured for ARMv8M Fast Model Simulator
                      
  V2M-MPS2:             configured for MPS2 (uses ULINK2 as debugger)

Secure Application:
 Setup core.
 Initialize LEDs.
 LED0:  function call from Secure to Secure code                                    using Secure SysTick.
 LED1:  function call from Secure to NonSecure code via registered function pointer using Secure SysTick.

NonSecure Application:
 LED7:  function call from NonSecure to NonSecure code                             using NonSecure SysTick.
 LED6:  function call from NonSecure to Secure Code via exported Secure functions  using NonSecure SysTick.
 LED5:  function call from NonSecure to NonSecure code                             using while loop.
 LED4:  function call from NonSecure to Secure code via exported Secure functions  using while loop.


Note:
  MPS2 image has no NonSecure SysTick
